SpeedScheduler-front-end
========================

First, you gotta get yourself a copy of https://github.com/jrcryan/SpeedScheduler running. Eventually, that will be running on a url like https://api.speedscheduler.com

Next, you gotta clone this repo and cd right into the root directory here. To get it running, just do the following:
```bash
$ npm install # install the project dependencies
$ npm run start
```

That's it! This project makes calls to the SpeedScheduler API to deliver the front-end user experience. Eventually, this will be running on a url like https://www.speedscheduler.com
